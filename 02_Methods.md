# Library preparation
    1.  Isolation of polyA RNA perfomed using the New England BioLabs (NEB) Poly(A) Magnetic Isolation Module following manufacturers instructions.

    2.  Library prepared using NEB Ultra II RNA library prep kit

        - Read length for sequencing 150bp, so long insert libraries not necessary.  
        - Follow standard protocol for 200bp insert size (15 minute fragmentation, 0.9X bead clean up following adapter ligation).
