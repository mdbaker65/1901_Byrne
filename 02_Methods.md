# Library preparation
    1.  Isolation of polyA RNA perfomed using the New England BioLabs (NEB) Poly(A) Magnetic Isolation Module following manufacturers instructions.

    2.  Library prepared using NEB Ultra II RNA library prep kit

        - Read length for sequencing 150bp, so long insert libraries not necessary.  
        - Follow standard protocol for 200bp insert size (15 minute fragmentation, 0.9X bead clean up following adapter ligation).
        - Indexes (Set 2) NP-BEIC-1 = F11; NP-BEIC-2 = F12

    3.  Bioanalyzer results
        Peak size
        - NP-BEIC-1 - 296bp
        - NP-BEIC-2 - 285bp

        Short fragment ~85bp in each sample.  Run 0.9X SPRI bead clean up to remove it.

    4.  Qubit Results (ng/ul)
        Following 0.9X SPRI bead clean up.  Eluted off beads into 22ul
        - NP-BEIC-1 = 6.26
        - NP-BEIC-2 = 17.0

 # Library pooling

    Dilute samples to 2nM with EB buffer and combine:

       Dilutions:
        - NP-BEIC-1 1:16  Qubit = 0.430 ng/ul > 2.2nM
        - NP-BEIC-2 1:44  Qubit = 0.430 ng/ul > 2.2nM

        Combine 10ul of each library into a new 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.
